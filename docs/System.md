### Reality

There is a big gap between `hello world` to Operating System. In fact a better `hello world` is also very hard, for example,

* [ ] Show in center
* [ ] Make a badge
* [ ] Flash the world

Let us make a basic structre first, that is to say, using C to learn HW, SW, and VM. Remember CLI or GUI is just a interface so can be very far from the real stuff.

### Hardware

The first computer is ENIAC, which was invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania :tent: in 1943. 

Now, computer is complex, and is composite of

- Case
- Motherboard
- CPU(Hardware_CPU.md) (Processor)
- BUS(Hardware_Bus.md) (Connection)
- GPU (Graphics Card)
- RAM (Memory]
- Storage Device (SSD, NVME SSD, HDD)
- Cooling (FAN, Chassis)
- PSU (Power Supply Unit)
- Display (Monitor, Screen)
- NIC
- Input Devices (Mouse, Keyboard, Camera, Speaker, Fingerprint)
- Bluetooth

### Software

There are many types according to the [CPU](Hardware_CPU.md) operation level, below is ARM.

- MSCP
- BIOS
- Grub
- OS

### Virtual

There are many virtual machines.

- QEMU
- FVP
- Box
- Gem5
- VMware
